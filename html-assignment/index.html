            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a student at Algonquin College in the Interactive Media Design Program. I come from Prince Edward County, Ontario and am currently living on residence here at the school. This is my first year of college as I took a gap year after my graduation from Highschool at <abbr title="Prince Edward Collegiate Institute">PECI</abbr>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an avid music listener, movie watcher, and sports fan. I enjoy creating art and playing video games in my free time.
