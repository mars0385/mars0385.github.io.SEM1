                    Every one of us can help limit global warming and take care of our planet. By changing our habits and making choices that have less harmful effects on the environment, we have the power to confront the climate challenge and build a more sustainable world.

                COVID-19 is a wake-up call from nature. Our lives depend on a healthy planet. Let’s seize the moment and change course – toward more sustainable lifestyles.
